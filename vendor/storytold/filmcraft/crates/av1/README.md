# filmcraft-av1

Clean-room, pure-Rust (no `unsafe`) AV1 decoder, implemented from the public **AV1 Bitstream &
Decoding Process Specification, version 1.0.0 with Errata 1** (AOMediaCodec/av1-spec, git
commit `5e04f3f`, 2023-06-12). It is an L0 crate: it depends only on `filmcraft-bitstream`,
`thiserror` and (optional, feature `threads`) `rayon`, and builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

All constant tables (default CDFs, scan orders, quantiser lookups, filter taps, …) and the
named constants are extracted from the specification's Markdown source by
[`tools/extract_tables.py`](tools/extract_tables.py) into `src/spec_tables.rs` (every table's
shape is checked against its declared dimensions; one missing comma in the spec's
`Split_Tx_Size` initialiser is reported and repaired). No code was taken from libaom, dav1d,
SVT-AV1 or any other implementation; ffmpeg (libsvtav1 to encode fixtures, libdav1d to decode the
reference) is used only as an external test oracle.

## Accuracy

`tests/oracle_intra.rs` encodes all-intra streams with ffmpeg's libsvtav1 (with and without the
in-loop filters; 64×64 and 128×128 superblocks; intra edge filter on and off) and compares every
decoded frame with libdav1d: **bit-exact** on all 13 fixtures (8- and 10-bit 4:2:0; 128×128 to
1280×720 including odd sizes; testsrc2, mandelbrot, gradients and noise; presets 1–8).

`tests/conformance.rs` downloads libaom's conformance test vectors on first use
(storage.googleapis.com/aom-test-data) and compares with libdav1d: `av1-1-b8-02-allintra`
(39 frames, deblocking + CDEF + self-guided restoration), `05-mv`, `06-mfmv`, `24-monochrome`
and `b10-23-film_grain-50` are **bit-exact** in the default run. The ignored
`conformance_vectors_extended` test covers the wider set; bit-exact today: `01-size-16x16`,
`-66x66`, `-196x196`, `-226x226`, `00-quantizer-00/31/63` (8-bit) and `-00/40` (10-bit),
`04-cdfupdate`, `05-mv`, `06-mfmv`, `22-svc-L1T2`, `22-svc-L2T1`, `22-svc-L2T2` (spatial layers
with scaled inter-layer prediction), `24-monochrome` (8 and 10-bit) and
`16-intra_only-intrabc-extreme-dv` (1080p intra block copy), `23-film_grain-50` (8 and 10-bit).

`tests/oracle_inter.rs` also checks draft mode: every unflagged frame stays bit-exact with
libdav1d and only flagged frames differ, with 1 and 4 threads. `tests/oracle_inter.rs` encodes SVT-AV1 GOPs (hierarchical references, compound prediction,
OBMC / warped motion, motion-field projection, all loop filters; presets 3–8, 8- and 10-bit, odd
sizes), plus super-resolution (denominator 12) and film-grain streams, and compares every frame
with libdav1d: **bit-exact** on all 6 fixtures.

## Threading and performance

`Decoder::new()` uses all cores (`Decoder::with_threads(1)` decodes on the calling thread; on
wasm32, or without the default `threads` feature, everything runs on the calling thread). Headers are parsed in order; each frame is
then decoded by a frame worker once the reference frames it reads are finished, so independent
frames (hierarchical GOP layers) decode concurrently; tiles of a frame decode in parallel into
private buffers that are merged afterwards. Results never depend on scheduling (the oracle tests
compare 1 thread, many threads and libdav1d). With frame threads, pictures may be returned by a
later `decode_pts` call or by `flush`; each carries the `pts` of the temporal unit that showed it.

`tests/perf.rs` (ignored) prints single-threaded fps (thread CPU time), per-stage ms/frame
(`Decoder::stats()`) and all-core fps for 1080p fixtures. The hot loops (sub-pixel filters,
CDEF, inverse transforms, deblocking, entropy decoding) are written for auto-vectorisation.

Measured 2026-10-01 on a 14-core Apple Silicon Mac (release build, SVT-AV1 preset 8 1080p
fixtures from `tests/perf.rs`), before (`31f8b3d`: hot loops only, no threading) and after tile / frame /
post-filter threading. The machine was heavily loaded by other builds during both runs (load
average 200–400), so the all-core wall figures understate what an idle machine reaches and are
noisy; single-threaded figures use thread CPU time and are comparable.

| Fixture | 1 thread before | 1 thread after | 14 threads before | 14 threads after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `perf_1080p_intra` (10 key frames) | 43.3 fps | 43.0 fps | 6.5 fps | 20.8 fps |
| `perf_1080p_gop` (60 frames, crf 30) | 45.5 fps | 40.7 fps | 7.7 fps | 11.0 fps |
| `perf_1080p_gop_10bit` | 41.3 fps | 35.9 fps | 8.0 fps | 6.6 fps |
| `perf_1080p_gop_hq` (crf 18) | 19.5 fps | 19.4 fps | 2.4 fps | 3.6 fps |
| `perf_1080p_gop_tiles` (4x2 tiles) | 44.4 fps | 44.7 fps | 2.7 fps | 16.3 fps |

### M4.10 (2026-10-03)

CPU cycles per frame counted by the kernel (`/usr/bin/time -l`, all threads summed; mean of two
interleaved base / after rounds at load average 190-320) with
`AV1_THREADS=n cargo run --release -p filmcraft-av1 --example av1dec -- in.ivf` on the
`cargo xtask bench` decode clips (SVT-AV1 preset 10, CRF 35, keyint 48, testsrc2 + grain),
bit-exact with libdav1d:

| stream | threads | Mcycles / frame before | after | after, draft mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1080p (120 frames) | 1 | 60.5 | **48.3** (−20 %) | 46.2 |
| 1080p | 14 | 63.6 | **51.9** (−18 %) | 50.3 |
| 2160p (72 frames) | 1 | 212.5 | **172.4** (−19 %) | 167.9 |
| 2160p | 14 | 220.0 | **177.1** (−20 %) | 171.1 |

What changed: the sub-pixel filter passes run over fixed block widths (taps outer, columns
inner); frame and tile-region planes come from a bounded pool of recycled buffers (zeroed on
reuse) instead of a fresh `calloc` and `munmap` per frame (allocation, page faults and zeroing
were ~10 % of the time); the palette mode-info arrays (40 bytes per 4x4 unit) are only
allocated when screen content tools are allowed; CDF adaptation is branch-free (a branch-free
symbol search was tried and was slower: most symbols have 2-4 values). Single-threaded 4K now
splits into coefficient parsing ~20 %, inter prediction ~18 %, other block-level parsing
~12 %, deblocking ~11 % (still one edge at a time), inverse transforms ~12 %, CDEF ~5 %.

Draft mode (`Decoder::set_draft(true)`, `AV1_DRAFT=1`; reduced-resolution playback only): shown
frames whose `refresh_frame_flags` is 0 — no reference slot keeps them, so neither their samples,
motion vectors nor CDFs reach another frame — skip deblocking, CDEF and loop restoration
(super-resolution still runs, it sets the output size) and are flagged `Picture::draft`. In
SVT-AV1's hierarchical GOPs that is the top layer, half of the frames.

## API

```rust
let mut dec = filmcraft_av1::Decoder::new();
for sample in samples {                  // one temporal unit (MP4 / Matroska sample) each
    for pic in dec.decode_pts(&sample, pts)? {   // shown frames ready so far, planar u16
        // pic.width, pic.height, pic.bit_depth, pic.planes[0..3], pic.pts
    }
}
let rest = dec.flush();                  // pictures still in flight at the end
```
