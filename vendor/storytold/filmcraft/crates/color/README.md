## Working units

The compositor works in linear light with **1.0 = reference white**: SDR white for SDR media, and
**203 cd/m²** for HDR (ITU-R BT.2408, "HDR Reference White"). SDR media keeps its values in an HDR
sequence (the BT.2408 SDR-in-HDR mapping), HDR highlights are values above 1.0, and log media
decodes to scene-linear reflectance (18 % grey = 0.18). Working primaries are BT.709 for a Rec. 709
sequence and BT.2020 for Rec. 2100 PQ/HLG sequences or when "wide gamut" is on.

## Camera log curves

Each curve is implemented from the manufacturer's published document. "Domain" is the normalisation
the document uses: **CV** = 10-bit code value / 1023 (full scale), **IRE** = video-range normalised
(code 64 → 0, code 940 → 1). `log::signal_from_normalized` converts the decoder's normalised value
(which already accounts for the file's range flag) into the curve domain, so the same formulas work
for limited- and full-range files.

The encoders are the exact inverses given in the same documents. DJI **D-Log M** is not
implemented: DJI has not published its formula (only conversion LUTs), and we do not derive curves
from third-party LUTs. (Checked again in October 2026: DJI's published white papers cover D-Log /
D-Gamut only; D-Log M remains unsupported, so D-Log M footage should be interpreted with a LUT.)

Matrices are derived from the chromaticities (SMPTE RP 177 normalised primary matrix); tests check
the result against the published BT.709 RGB→XYZ and BT.2087 BT.709→BT.2020 matrices.

## HDR transfer functions

* **PQ** (SMPTE ST 2084 / BT.2100): decoded to absolute cd/m², then divided by 203.
* **HLG** (ARIB STD-B67 / BT.2100): inverse OETF to scene light, then the BT.2100 OOTF
  `Fd = Lw·Ys^(γ−1)·E` with Lw = 1000 cd/m², γ = 1.2 and Ys from BT.2020 luma, then ÷ 203. A 75 %
  HLG signal lands at reference white (BT.2408). HLG export applies the inverse OOTF and the OETF.

## Tone mapping (HDR/log → SDR)

When an HDR or log source enters a Rec. 709 working space with **Auto Tone Map Media** on (the
default), and on the monitors of an HDR sequence, FilmCraft applies the **ITU-R BT.2390 EETF**:

1. m = max(R, G, B) in working units, converted to cd/m² (×203) and PQ-encoded, normalised by the
   PQ value of the source peak;
2. below the knee KS = 1.5·maxLum − 0.5 (maxLum = PQ(target peak)/PQ(source peak)) the value is
   unchanged; above it a Hermite spline maps the rest of the range onto [KS, maxLum];
3. RGB is scaled by m'/m, which keeps hue and saturation.

Source peak: the content's mastering peak for PQ when known (default 1000 cd/m²), 1000 cd/m² for
HLG, and for log media the curve's own peak capped at 4000 cd/m² (so the knee starts above mid
grey). Target peak: 203 cd/m² = SDR white. HDR reference white then lands at ≈ 0.79 linear (≈ 90 %
on the sRGB curve).

## Grading signal (`grade`)

Lumetri's controls work on a 0…1 signal. `GradeSpace` picks it from the working space:

| Working space | Signal of working-linear `c` (1.0 = 203 cd/m² in HDR) | 1.0 means |
|---|---|---|
| Rec. 709 | sRGB curve, clamped back to 0…1 | SDR white |
| Rec. 2100 PQ | `PQ⁻¹(c·203/10000) / PQ⁻¹(W/10000)` (SMPTE ST 2084) | HDR White `W` cd/m² |
| Rec. 2100 HLG | `F = c·203/W`, `Y = BT.2020 luma(F)`, `E = F·Y^((1−γ)/γ)`, signal = HLG OETF(E), γ = 1.2 + 0.42·log10(W/1000) (BT.2100 inverse OOTF, note 5f) | display peak `W` |

`W` is Lumetri's HDR White (Basic Correction) or HDR Range (Curves), default 1000 cd/m². HDR
values above `W` are signals above 1 and are kept (PQ to 10 000 cd/m², HLG to signal 1.5). Checked
values: PQ 100 / 203 / 1000 cd/m² = 0.508 / 0.581 / 0.752 of the plain PQ signal (BT.2408); HLG on
a 1000 cd/m² display: 203 cd/m² = 0.75, 26 cd/m² (18 % grey) ≈ 0.38 (BT.2408).

## HDR static metadata

`HdrMetadata` (mastering display max / min luminance, MaxCLL, MaxFALL; 0 = unknown) gives the
tone-mapping source peak of PQ media: MaxCLL when known (the brightest pixel of the content),
else the mastering peak, clamped to 203…10 000 cd/m²; without metadata 1000 cd/m² is assumed.

## Gamut mapping

* **Input** (camera gamuts wider than the working gamut): per-channel distance compression towards
  the achromatic axis, after the ACES Reference Gamut Compression: for each channel
  d = (max − c)/max; distances below 0.8 are unchanged, distances from 0.8 to 1.25 are compressed
  into 0.8–1.0 with a power-1.2 curve. Colours within 80 % of the boundary are untouched.
* **Display-referred wide-gamut input** (BT.2020 / P3 / PQ / HLG media into a narrower working
  gamut) and
* **Output** (BT.2020 working → BT.709 monitor/export): colours with a negative component are
  desaturated towards their BT.709 luminance just enough to fit (`desaturate_into_gamut`); in-gamut
  colours, such as BT.709 media in a wide-gamut sequence, come back exactly.

## LUTs

* `.cube`: the published Cube LUT 1.0 text format — `TITLE`, `LUT_1D_SIZE` (2–65536), `LUT_3D_SIZE`
  (2–256), `DOMAIN_MIN`/`DOMAIN_MAX`, legacy `LUT_1D_INPUT_RANGE`/`LUT_3D_INPUT_RANGE`, comments,
  CRLF. A file with both sizes is a 1D shaper followed by a cube. Red changes fastest.
* `.3dl`: optional `3DMESH` / `Mesh <in> <out>` header, the input mesh line (non-uniform meshes
  become a 1D shaper), `n³` integer rows with blue fastest; output depth from the header or the
  largest value. We write 33-point, 10-bit-mesh, 12-bit-output files.
* 3D interpolation is **tetrahedral**. Tests compare it with a brute-force reference (barycentric
  coordinates in each of the six Kuhn tetrahedra, solved with a 3×3 inverse) on random points for
  sizes 2–33, check exactness on affine LUTs and at grid nodes, and round-trip both formats.

FilmCraft ships no LUT files. Its built-in looks and camera conversions are generated from code
(`filmcraft-render`), and are written to disk only when the user exports them.

## Tests

`cargo test -p filmcraft-color`: encode∘decode round trips for every curve (−1 % to 8× and over
the full signal range in both file ranges), published reference points (S-Log3 95/420/598, V-Log
128/433/602, LogC3 18 % → 0.391, LogC4 18 % → 0.2784, Canon Log 2/3 18 % → 39.2 %/34.3 % IRE, Apple
Log 18 % → 0.488, D-Log 0 → 0.0929), PQ/HLG reference white, EETF continuity/monotonicity and peak,
hue preservation, gamut compression, BT.709/BT.2087 matrices, LUT interpolation and file round
trips.
