# filmcraft-captions

Caption files and caption burn-in for FilmCraft (layer L2: depends on `filmcraft-time`,
`filmcraft-color`, `filmcraft-project`, `filmcraft-text` and `roxmltree` for TTML).

The caption *model* (caption tracks in a sequence, captions, track style) lives in
`filmcraft-project` (`caption.rs`) because it is part of the `.fcproj` document. This crate reads
and writes caption files, converts them to and from caption tracks, and draws captions.

## Formats

| Format | Read | Write | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| SubRip `.srt` | yes | yes | BOM, UTF-16, Windows-1252 fallback, CRLF/CR, missing or wrong indexes, `,` or `.` milliseconds, 1–9 fraction digits, missing hours, SSA coordinates, cues not separated by blank lines. Inline tags are kept as text. |
| WebVTT `.vtt` | yes | yes | Cue identifiers, cue settings (verbatim), a leading `<v Speaker>` voice span (as the caption's speaker) and STYLE / REGION / NOTE blocks are kept. A missing `WEBVTT` signature is tolerated. |
| Scenarist SCC `.scc` | yes | yes | CEA-608 at 29.97 fps, drop-frame or not. Reads pop-on, roll-up and paint-on (channel 1); writes pop-on. |
| MacCaption MCC `.mcc` | yes | yes | One SMPTE ST 334-2 caption distribution packet (CDP) per frame in MacCaption's hex text with letter abbreviations. Writes 29.97 fps (`30DF` / `30`) with CEA-608 field 1 (the SCC schedule) **and** CEA-708 service 1 (two-window pop-on emulation). Reads CEA-608 field 1 when present, else CEA-708 service 1; time code rates 30DF, 30, 60DF, 60, 25, 24, 50. |
| EBU STL `.stl` | yes | yes | EBU Tech 3264-E: GSI block + 128-byte TTI blocks, `STL25.01` (25 fps) or `STL30.01` (read/written as 29.97 fps, non-drop labels), ISO/IEC 6937 Latin text (accents as diacritic + letter), italics / underline codes as `<i>` / `<u>`, extension blocks for long subtitles, start-of-programme (TCP) subtracted. |
| TTML `.ttml` (IMSC1) | yes | yes | Writes the IMSC1 Text profile (TTML2 namespaces): `<p>` per cue, `<br/>`, styled `<span>`s for `<i>` / `<b>` / `<u>`, `ttm:agent` speakers, exact frame times (`123f`) at the sequence rate. Reads any TTML (TTML1, TTML2, the 2006 `ttaf1` drafts): clock / frame / offset / tick times, `dur`, nested time containers, timed spans, referenced styles. |
| DFXP `.dfxp` | yes | yes | TTML1 with the DFXP presentation profile; clock times in milliseconds (frame-exact after `snap_to_frames`). |

All cue times are exact `Tick`s. Milliseconds convert exactly (1 ms = 254 016 000 ticks); SCC
frames map through `FrameRate::FPS_29_97`. `Document::snap_to_frames` snaps cues to a sequence's
frame grid (the engine does this on import) and removes overlaps.

### SCC writer

Each caption is sent as a pop-on load (RCL, ENM, then per row a preamble address code and tab
offset for centring, then text; control codes doubled) into non-displayed memory, followed by End
Of Caption exactly on the caption's first frame. The load is placed in the latest run of free
frames before the caption, so back-to-back captions load while the previous one is on screen. An
Erase Displayed Memory clears the caption at its out point unless the next caption replaces it.
Text is wrapped at 32 columns, bottom-aligned (last row 15) and centred. Characters come from the
608 basic, special and extended sets (extended characters are preceded by a basic fallback
character, as the standard requires); others are dropped. If there is no room to load a caption
before its in point (for example a caption at 00:00:00:00), it appears as soon as it is loaded.

## Burn-in

`burn::render_caption` lays out a caption with the track style (font size relative to a 1080-line
frame, colour, background box, outline, alignment, top/middle/bottom anchor and margin; WebVTT
`line:N%` and `align:` settings override them), wraps lines to 90% of the frame width and
rasterises it to a small premultiplied linear-light RGBA overlay. `filmcraft-render` composites the
overlays of visible caption tracks over the finished frame (Program monitor and export burn-in).

Text is set in **Inter SemiBold** (`assets/fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf`, SIL OFL 1.1, attributed in
`ATTRIBUTION.md`) by the `filmcraft-text` engine: shaped with kerning and ligatures, bidi-ordered,
and drawn from its sub-pixel positioned glyph cache.

Specifications used: SMPTE ST 334-2 (CDP structure), CEA-608 / CEA-708 (public descriptions of
the caption commands), the MacCaption MCC format description (line syntax and abbreviations),
EBU Tech 3264-E (1991), ISO/IEC 6937, W3C TTML1 (2nd ed.), TTML2 and IMSC 1.1. No other
implementation's code was consulted.

## Tests

- Unit tests per module (timestamps, decoding, sloppy SRT, WebVTT blocks and voices, CEA-608
  tables, PAC round trips, known SCC pop-on and roll-up streams, layout).
- `tests/roundtrip.rs`: property tests — SRT (also with BOM + CRLF), WebVTT (ids, speakers,
  settings, STYLE blocks), SCC and MCC (drop-frame and non-drop, gaps and back-to-back captions;
  MCC also through CEA-708 alone), EBU STL (25 and 29.97 fps, accents, extension blocks), TTML
  (23.976 / 25 / 29.97 / 59.94, ids, speakers) round-trip frame-exactly; DFXP round-trips after
  snapping to frames; readers never panic on random bytes (also a valid STL header followed by
  random blocks, and random MCC lines); SRT → VTT → SCC keeps text and frames.
