# filmcraft-audio-dsp

Real-time audio DSP for FilmCraft. Layer **L1**, **no dependencies**, compiles for
`wasm32-unknown-unknown`, no `unsafe`. Clean-room: written from the public standards
(ITU-R BS.1770-4, EBU R128 / Tech 3341 / Tech 3342) and textbook DSP (RBJ cookbook biquads,
Householder FDN, phase vocoder, spectral subtraction with the statistical late-reverberation
model).

## Conventions

- Planar `f32` audio: `&mut [&mut [f32]]`, one slice per channel, equal lengths.
- Effects are built (allocating) with `(sample_rate, channels)`; `process`, `set_param` and
  `reset` never allocate.
- Parameters change between blocks and are smoothed per sample; output does not depend on how
  the stream is cut into blocks (tested for every effect with 0/1/random-size blocks).
- Recursive state is flushed below ~1e-30, so no denormals without CPU FTZ flags.

## Loudness (`loudness`)

`LoudnessMeter::new(sample_rate, channels)` → `process(&[&[f32]])` / `process_interleaved`, then
`momentary()`, `short_term()`, `integrated()`, `loudness_range()`, `sample_peak()`,
`true_peak()` / `true_peak_dbtp()`, `summary()`.

- K-weighting derived for any sample rate by bilinear transform (matches the 48 kHz BS.1770 table).
- Gated integrated loudness (−70 LUFS / −10 LU) and LRA (−70 / −20 LU, 10th–95th percentile) use a
  0.01 LU histogram with exact energy sums: fixed memory for programmes of any length.
- True peak: 4× (2× at 88.2/96 kHz) polyphase Kaiser-sinc interpolation.
- Oracle-tested against ffmpeg's `ebur128` filter (`tests/loudness_oracle.rs`, skipped without ffmpeg):
  M/S within 0.0005 LU, I within 0.007 LU, LRA within 0.04 LU and true peak within 0.045 dB (0.053 dB of the analytic value on an fs/4 tone) on
  sine, pink-noise, speech-like and gated stereo signals at 44.1/48/96 kHz.
- `normalize_gain_db(measured, target)` and `normalize_gain_db_peak_limited(...)` for Normalize /
  Essential Sound loudness auto-match.

## Effects (`effects`)

All implement `AudioEffect` (`id`, `params`, `set_param`, `param`, `reset`, `process`, `latency`).
`effects()` lists `EffectInfo { id, name, category, params, create }`; each `ParamSpec` has
id, name, range, default, `Unit`, log-scale hint and choice labels so UIs can be generated.

`AudioEffect::response_db(freq)` (EQs and filters) and `transfer_db(band, input_db)` (dynamics)
expose the analytic curves for the graphical effect editors. Modulation effects start their LFO
at the beginning of a chain, so a random-access render may differ in LFO phase from continuous
playback.

`effects::premiere_tests` checks every effect: neutral settings are (delayed) identity, output is
deterministic and latency constant (impulse lands at `latency()`), plus a level / frequency-response
test on generated tones, noise or impulses and a realtime-factor floor.

Essential Sound builds on these (Repair: `denoise`, high-pass via `parametric_eq`, `dehum`,
`deesser`, `dereverb`; Clarity: `compressor`, `simple_eq`, `speech_enhance`; Creative: `reverb`,
`stereo_width`).

**Enhance Speech decision.** No machine-learning model is bundled: we found no openly licensed
speech-enhancement model that is also practical to ship here (pure Rust, wasm, asset rules).
DeepFilterNet (MIT/Apache-2.0, with a Rust implementation on `tract`) is the candidate for a future
optional integration behind a trait outside this dependency-free crate, once its weights' licence and
size are vetted as an asset. Until then `speech_enhance` is the DSP chain above.

Measured on synthetic signals (`effects::essential::tests`, 48 kHz):

| Effect | Signal | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `deesser` | 150 Hz harmonic voice + 5–10 kHz noise bursts | sibilance −5.1 dB (8 dB max) / −9.8 dB (16 dB max) during bursts; voice band ±0.01 dB; non-sibilant passages ±0.001 dB |
| `dereverb` (100 %) | harmonic syllables (100 ms / 400 ms gaps) + Polack-model late reverb, RT60 0.8 s | tail-to-burst energy −5.0 → −10.1 dB (5.0 dB better); burst energy −1.7 dB |
| `speech_enhance` | voice + fricative noise syllables over −60 dBFS noise | presence/mud tilt +5.5 dB; noise between syllables −8.7 dB; overall level +1.0 dB |
| Dialogue chain | `denoise` + `parametric_eq` (2 HP bands) + `dehum` + `deesser` + `dereverb` + `compressor` + `simple_eq` + `speech_enhance` + `reverb`, 60 s stereo | 1.36 s = **44× realtime** on one core (release, Apple Silicon; `cargo test --release -p filmcraft-audio-dsp dialogue_chain_realtime -- --ignored --nocapture`) |

## Ducking analysis (`ducking`)

Pure functions for Essential Sound auto-ducking:

- `envelope_db(channels, sample_rate, hop_s, window_s)`: centred-window RMS level per hop (dBFS,
  channel-averaged power, floor −120).
- `activity(env_db, hop_s, threshold_db, min_on_s, bridge_s)`: regions above the threshold; gaps
  shorter than `bridge_s` are merged first, then regions shorter than `min_on_s` are dropped.
- `sensitivity_threshold_db(s)`: Sensitivity 0–10 → −20 − 4·s dBFS.
- `duck_keyframes(regions, clip_start, clip_end, base_db, reduce_db, fade_s)`: (time, dB) volume
  keyframes — ramp down over `fade_s` before each region, hold, ramp up after; overlapping ramps
  merge; clamped to the clip (a ramp cut by an edge gets the ramp's value at the edge); strictly
  increasing times.

## Audio synchronisation (`sync`)

`find_offset(a, b, sample_rate, &SyncOptions)` returns the lag `L` with `b[n] ≈ g·a[n + L]`, a
sub-sample estimate, and two trust figures (`confidence` = peak / RMS of the correlation,
`distinct` = peak / next peak > 50 ms away; `reliable()` = ≥ 8 and ≥ 1.5).

- Coarse: DC removal + normalisation, Blackman-windowed-sinc decimation to ≤ 8 kHz (further for
  long recordings, so the transform stays ≤ 4 M points), GCC-PHAT-β (`R = A·B*/|A·B*|^0.75`,
  40 Hz – 0.4·rate band) with both signals packed into one complex FFT.
- Refine: the same correlation at the full rate on the loudest common window (≤ 2¹⁷ samples), ±2
  coarse steps around the coarse peak, parabolic interpolation.
- Tested within one sample on speech-like multi-microphone signals (gains −20…+10 dB, SNR down to
  3 dB, coloured microphones, fractional delays: worst 0.4 samples integer / 0.11 samples
  sub-sample), a 0 dB SNR room with a strong echo, inverted polarity, unrelated signals
  (unreliable) and `max_lag`. Two 10-minute recordings: 2.4 s (release, one core).

## Known limits

- Effects assume ≤ the channel count they were built with; extra channels pass through
  (channel-generic gain effects process all of them).
- DeNoise adapts continuously; a perfectly stationary tone is (by design) treated as noise after
  ~1.5 s. There is no explicit "learn noise print" mode yet.
- Filter type / choice changes switch immediately (continuous parameters are smoothed).
